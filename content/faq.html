### Getting Started


#####Q. How do I get started with Binstar?

A. First, you will need to sign up for a Binstar account [here](https://binstar.org/).  Then install the [Binstar client](https://github.com/binstar/binstar_client), available via conda and pip.  Although you can perform many tasks from the website, the Binstar client is required to build and upload packages.

{% endcall %}

{% call section('Accounts') %}

###Accounts

#####Q. What kind of account do I have?

A. By default your account is a personal, free account.  All packages you upload to Binstar will be public, and you will be the only person with administrative access to your account.

#####Q. How can I upgrade my account?

A. You can upgrade to a paid account [here](https://binstar.org/settings/billing).  This will allow you to create private packages and increase your storage limit.

#####Q. What is an organization? How is it different from an individual account?

A. An organization is a more robust account, which allows multiple individual users to administer packages and have more granular control of package access by other users.

###Packages


#####Q. What kind of packages does Binstar support?

Binstar supports conda and PyPI packages.


#####Q. Who can find and install my packages?
A. By default, all of your packages are public, and after you upload them to Binstar anyone can search for and download them.  To enable private package uploading, you can [purchase a paid account](https://binstar.org/about/plans/).  For information on searching for public packages, please go [here](/faq.html#finding-packages).

#####Q. How do I build and upload a package?

{% endcall %}

{% call section('Channels') %}

###Channels

#####Q. What is a channel?

A. Channels are one way Binstar helps you control who can access your packages.  When you tag a package as belonging to a specific channel, only users who are listening to that channel will see the package and be able to install it.

By default, all packages you upload are sent to your `main` channel.  However, you could also have a `dev` channel that only your internal development team can access.  You can upload a package to the `dev` channel, allow other internal users to test it, and then promote it to the `main` channel when it is ready to be released.  You can find more information on channels [here](/channels.html).


{% endcall %}

{% call section('Tokens') %}

### Tokens

#####Q. What is a token?
A. A token is the mechanism by which you authenticate to the Binstar client.  In addition, you can generate new tokens to give other users specifically scoped access to packages and collections.  You can find more information on tokens [here](/token_gen.html).
